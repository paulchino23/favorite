            <h3>Playing soccer is my favorite hobby, because it is so much fun. I like it because I get to be outdoors, play with my friends and be active. Playing soccer has been a part of my life since i was 6 years old and I still love it like the first day.  Soccer teaches you to play working with the others in a team environment. I have had the opportunity to go to the stadium of the professional team in town the Xolos, and I have visited stadiums in other cities.</h3>
